* Breast cancer is a major health concern, underscoring the importance of early detection. The RSNA dataset provides mammograms for developing an accurate deep learning model. Preprocessing techniques enhance generalization, and a specialized CNN is trained on the RSNA dataset to extract features and detect breast cancers. Transfer learning with models like EfficientNetB3 or Inception improves performance by leveraging knowledge from large-scale datasets. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and pf-1 score ensure a reliable deep learning model to aid healthcare professionals in breast cancer diagnosis.
